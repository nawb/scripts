Repo for scripts I've written for personal use.

To start using,
> git clone https://github.com/nawb/scripts.git
> ln -s $(pwd)/scriptname /usr/bin/scriptname

* scrn: runs scrot (screenshot tool) in Select Region/Window mode and automatically saves it to specified directory.

* silver-shoes: opens a tumblr tab

Other scripts in my gists (with some overlap).
